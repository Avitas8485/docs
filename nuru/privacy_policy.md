# Nuru - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 4th May, 2025**

## 1. Introduction

Nuru ("Nuru," "we," "our," "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use the Nuru mobile application and associated website (collectively, the "Platform").

By accessing or using our Platform, you signify your understanding of and consent to the collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the Platform.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve our Service. The types of information we collect include:

### 2.1 Information You Provide Directly:

- **Account Registration Data**: When you create an account, we collect information such as your name, email address, phone number, password, your role (Client or Freelancer), and profile picture (optional).
- **Profile Information**: Freelancers may provide details about their skills, experience, location (city/region), portfolio items, education, and other professional qualifications. Clients may provide company information (if applicable).
- **Project Information**: Information included in Project postings (by Clients) or applications (by Freelancers), including descriptions, requirements, budgets, and attachments.
- **Communications Data**: Messages exchanged between users via the Platform's messaging system, and communications with Nuru support.
- **Verification Data (Optional)**: If you choose to use optional verification features, we (or our third-party partners) may collect government ID information or other credentials necessary for that specific verification process.

### 2.2 Information Collected Automatically:

- **Usage Data**: Information about how you interact with the Platform, such as features used, screens viewed, searches performed, clicks, and timestamps.
- **Device Information**: Information about the device you use to access the Platform, including device type, operating system and version, unique device identifiers (e.g., Android ID), browser type, and mobile network information.
- **Log Data**: Server logs may automatically record information like your IP address, access times, app crashes, and system activity.
- **Approximate Location**: We may infer your general geographic location (e.g., city, country) based on your IP address or information you provide in your profile.
- **Cookies and Similar Technologies**: We may use cookies (small text files stored on your device) and similar technologies (like pixels or local storage) to operate the service, remember your preferences, analyze usage, and potentially for marketing purposes (subject to your consent where required).

### 2.3 Information Related to Payments (for Nuru Features):

- **No User-to-User Payment Data**: We DO NOT collect or store bank account details, mobile money information, or credit card numbers related to payments between Clients and Freelancers, as these occur outside the Platform.
- **Nuru Feature Payments**: When you purchase optional Nuru features (boosts, subscriptions) via Google Play Billing (or future processors like Stripe/PayPal), the payment is processed by that third party. We do not receive your full payment card number or bank details. We may receive transaction confirmation details, subscription status, purchase history (for Nuru features only), and identifiers necessary to associate the payment with your Nuru account. These third-party processors handle your payment information according to their own privacy policies.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for various purposes, including:

- **Providing and Operating the Service**: To create and manage your account, facilitate connections between Clients and Freelancers, enable communication, display profiles and projects.
- **Improving the Platform**: To understand how users interact with Nuru, analyze usage patterns, identify areas for improvement, develop new features, and fix bugs.
- **Personalization**: To tailor content and features (e.g., suggesting relevant projects or freelancers).
- **Communication**: To send you service-related notifications (e.g., new message alerts, project updates, policy changes), respond to your support requests, and potentially send marketing communications (with your consent where required).
- **Safety and Security**: To verify accounts (where applicable), detect and prevent fraud, spam, abuse, security incidents, and other harmful activity.
- **Monetization**: To process payments for Nuru's paid features via third-party processors (like Google Play Billing) and manage subscriptions.
- **Legal Compliance**: To comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or governmental requests, and to enforce our Terms of Service.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing (for users in applicable regions like the EU/EEA)

If you are located in a jurisdiction with specific data protection laws (like the GDPR in Europe), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the information concerned and the context:

- **Performance of a Contract**: Processing necessary to provide the Nuru service you requested (e.g., creating your account, enabling messaging).
- **Legitimate Interests**: Processing for our legitimate interests (e.g., improving the Platform, security, fraud prevention), provided these are not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights.
- **Consent**: Where required by law, we will obtain your consent for specific processing activities (e.g., certain marketing communications, use of non-essential cookies). You can withdraw consent at any time.
- **Legal Obligation**: Processing necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

## 5. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information. We may share your information in the following circumstances:

- **With Other Users**: Your profile information (name, photo, skills, location, reviews) is visible to other users to facilitate connections. Messages you send are visible to the recipient(s). Project details are visible as intended by the posting Client.
- **With Third-Party Service Providers**: We engage trusted third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, data storage, analytics, push notifications, payment processing for Nuru features, customer support tools). These providers have access to your information only to perform these tasks and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes. Key providers include:
  - Google Cloud / Firebase: For backend infrastructure, database hosting, authentication, analytics, and push notifications. (See Google's Privacy Policy)
  - Google Play Billing: For processing payments for Nuru's premium features on Android. (See Google Payments Privacy Notice)
  - [List any other significant providers like analytics tools, CRM, etc.]
- **For Legal Reasons**: We may disclose your information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to:
  - Comply with the law or legal proceedings.
  - Protect the safety, rights, or property of Nuru, our users, or the public.
  - Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
  - Enforce our Terms of Service.
- **Business Transfers**: If Nuru is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.
- **Aggregated or Anonymized Data**: We may share aggregated or anonymized information (which does not identify you personally) for industry analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, or other business purposes.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide you with the Service. We may also retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for legitimate business purposes (e.g., for backup, archival, fraud prevention).

When you request account deletion, we will take steps to delete your information, although some data may be retained in backups or logs for a limited period before being automatically overwritten or anonymized, or as required by law. Information shared with other users (like messages or reviews) may remain visible.

- Implementing authentication and access controls.
- Regularly reviewing our security practices.

However, please be aware that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information. You use the Platform and provide information at your own risk.

## 9. Children's Privacy

The Nuru Platform is not intended for or directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it promptly. If you believe a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## 10. International Data Transfers

Nuru is based in the State of Georgia, and our primary data storage is in the United States (via Google Cloud/Firebase). If you are accessing the Platform from outside the United States (e.g., Tanzania, East Africa), please be aware that your information will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or other countries where our service providers operate. Data protection laws in these countries may differ from those in your country of residence. By using the Platform, you consent to the transfer of your information to countries outside your residence, including the United States.

## 11. Third-Party Links

The Platform may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Nuru (e.g., links in user profiles or project descriptions).
