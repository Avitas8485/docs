Nuru - Terms of Service
Last Updated: 4th May 2025
1. Introduction & Acceptance of Terms
Welcome to Nuru ("Nuru," "we," "us," or "our"). Nuru operates a mobile and web-based platform designed to connect individuals and businesses seeking services ("Clients") with skilled professionals, service providers, and artisans ("Freelancers") primarily within Tanzania and the broader East African region (collectively, the "Service" or "Platform").
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Nuru Platform. Our Privacy Policy, available at https://github.com/Avitas8485/docs/blob/main/nuru/privacy_policy.md, is incorporated by reference into these Terms and explains how we collect and use your information.
BY CREATING AN ACCOUNT, ACCESSING, OR USING THE NURU PLATFORM IN ANY WAY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE PLATFORM.
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of significant changes (e.g., via in-app notification or email). Your continued use of the Platform after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
2. Eligibility
To use the Nuru Platform, you must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into binding contracts under applicable law. By registering for or using the Service, you represent and warrant that:
* You meet the age requirement.
* You have the legal authority to agree to these Terms (either for yourself or the entity you represent).
* All information you provide during registration and subsequently is truthful, accurate, current, and complete.
* You will maintain the accuracy of this information.
* Your use of the Platform does not and will not violate any applicable laws or regulations in your jurisdiction or in Tanzania.
Nuru reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account and access to the Service, without notice, if we suspect you have violated any part of these Terms, provided false information, or engaged in prohibited conduct.
3. The Nuru Platform - What We Do and Do Not Do
Nuru provides a technology platform that functions as a marketplace:
* Clients can post job requests or service needs ("Projects").
* Freelancers can create profiles showcasing their skills and experience, and apply for Projects.
* The Platform facilitates communication between Clients and Freelancers via an in-app messaging system.
* The Platform provides tools like ratings, reviews, and optional verification badges to help build trust.
CRITICAL DISCLAIMER: Nuru's Role is Strictly Limited.
Nuru is NOT a party to any agreement or transaction between Clients and Freelancers. All service agreements, whether written or verbal, are solely between the users.
Nuru DOES NOT process, handle, hold, escrow, guarantee, or mediate payments between Clients and Freelancers. All financial arrangements, negotiations, and transactions (e.g., via mobile money like M-Pesa/Tigo Pesa, bank transfer, cash) occur entirely outside the Nuru Platform and directly between the users. Users are solely responsible for arranging and collecting payments.
Nuru DOES NOT employ Freelancers. Freelancers using the Platform are independent contractors, not employees, agents, partners, or joint venturers of Nuru.
Nuru DOES NOT supervise, direct, control, or monitor the work performed by Freelancers.
Nuru DOES NOT guarantee the quality, safety, legality, timeliness, or accuracy of:
Freelancer services.
Client Project descriptions or requirements.
The truthfulness or accuracy of user profiles, ratings, reviews, or other user-generated content.
The ability of Freelancers to deliver services or Clients to pay for them.
Nuru DOES NOT perform comprehensive background checks on users. While we may offer optional verification features (like ID checks or skill badges), these are limited and do not constitute an endorsement or guarantee of any user's identity, reliability, or suitability.
Users interact with each other and enter into service agreements entirely at their own risk. You are solely responsible for vetting potential Clients or Freelancers, negotiating terms, ensuring payment, and resolving any disputes that may arise.
4. Account Registration and User Conduct
Account Security: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login credentials (username, password) and for all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
Accurate Information: You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current, and complete information in your profile and communications.
Prohibited Conduct: You agree not to:
Impersonate any person or entity, or falsely state or misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.
Create multiple accounts for fraudulent purposes or to circumvent Platform rules or suspensions.
Use the Platform for any illegal, fraudulent, malicious, or harmful activity.
Post false, misleading, defamatory, harassing, or obscene content.
Violate the intellectual property rights of Nuru or any third party.
Circumvent or attempt to circumvent Nuru's messaging system to avoid potential future platform fees (if introduced) or for prohibited purposes.
Use bots, spiders, scrapers, or other automated means to access or collect data from the Platform without our express written permission.
Interfere with the proper working of the Platform or impose an unreasonable load on our infrastructure.
Attempt to solicit payment information or conduct financial transactions through the Nuru messaging system (remember, payments happen outside Nuru).
Violate any applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations.
Violation of these conduct rules may result in account suspension or termination, and potentially legal action.
5. Interactions Between Users & Projects
Project Postings: Clients are responsible for accurately describing the scope, requirements, budget (if applicable), and any other relevant details of their Projects.
Applications & Agreements: Freelancers are responsible for accurately representing their skills, experience, and ability to complete Projects they apply for. Any agreement reached between a Client and a Freelancer constitutes a direct contract between them, to which Nuru is not a party.
Communication: Users agree to communicate professionally and respectfully via the Platform's messaging system for project-related discussions.
Disputes Between Users: Nuru has no obligation to mediate or resolve disputes between Users. Nuru is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from disputes between Users, including issues related to service quality, payment, or non-performance. Users are solely responsible for resolving their own disputes.
6. Nuru Platform Fees & Monetization (Payments to Nuru)
Freemium Model: Basic use of Nuru (creating profiles, posting limited jobs, applying for jobs) may be free.
Paid Features: Nuru offers optional paid features to enhance visibility or functionality, such as:
Profile boosts or featured placements for Freelancers.
Project promotions for Clients.
Subscription plans offering advanced tools or higher usage limits.
Optional verification badges.
Payment Processing (for Nuru Features): All payments made to Nuru for these optional features are processed exclusively through Google Play Billing (for Android app purchases) or potentially other third-party payment processors (like Stripe or PayPal for web/future options) as specified at the time of purchase.
NO User-to-User Payments: We reiterate: Nuru DOES NOT process payments between Clients and Freelancers. Do not attempt to use Google Play Billing or any Nuru payment mechanism to pay Freelancers for their services.
Third-Party Terms: Purchases made via Google Play Billing are subject to Google's terms and privacy policies. You are responsible for understanding and agreeing to those terms. Nuru does not store your full credit card or bank account details.
Refunds: Fees paid to Nuru for optional features are generally non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or the terms of the third-party payment processor (e.g., Google Play).
7. Intellectual Property Rights
Nuru's IP: The Nuru Platform, including its software, design, text, graphics, logos, trademarks, and other content ("Nuru Content"), is the property of Nuru or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Platform solely for its intended purposes according to these Terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or create derivative works from any part of the Nuru Content or Platform without our prior written consent.
User Content: You retain ownership of the original content you post or upload to the Platform (e.g., profile information, portfolio items, project descriptions) ("User Content"). However, by submitting User Content, you grant Nuru a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform your User Content in connection with operating, promoting, and improving the Service. This license allows us, for example, to display your profile to potential Clients or showcase project details. You represent and warrant that you have the necessary rights to grant this license for any User Content you submit.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE PLATFORM IS TO STOP USING IT.
10. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Nuru, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and partners from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with:

* Your User Content.
* Your interactions or agreements with other Users (including disputes related to payments or services).
* Your violation of these Terms.
* Your violation of any applicable law or regulation.

11. Termination
Termination by You: You may terminate your account and stop using the Service at any time by contacting us or using account deletion features if available.
Termination by Nuru: We may suspend or terminate your account and access to the Platform, in our sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including but not limited to:
Breach of these Terms or the Privacy Policy.
Engaging in fraudulent, illegal, or harmful activities.

Extended periods of inactivity.

Sections of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination (including, but not limited to, Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and General Provisions) shall survive. Termination does not relieve you of obligations incurred prior to termination (e.g., payment obligations to Nuru for services already rendered).
12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
Governing Law: These Terms and any dispute arising out of or related to them or the Platform shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
Jurisdiction: You agree that any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Platform shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Gwinnett, and you irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.
Note on International Use: While these Terms are governed by US law, if you are using the Platform from Tanzania or another jurisdiction, local laws may also apply to your activities and interactions, particularly concerning consumer rights, employment classification (for Freelancers), and taxation. Compliance with local laws is your responsibility.
Informal Resolution: We encourage you to contact us first at athalnir713@gmail.com to resolve any disputes directly. We will try to resolve disputes informally where possible.
13. General Provisions
Entire Agreement: These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Nuru regarding your use of the Platform and supersede all prior agreements or understandings.
Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
No Waiver: Nuru's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
Assignment: You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, by operation of law or otherwise, without Nuru's prior written consent. Nuru may assign these Terms freely without restriction.
Notices: Any notices or other communications provided by Nuru under these Terms may be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Platform. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
